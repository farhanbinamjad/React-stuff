                <h1>
                    It's Been A While
                </h1>
                <h3>This essay will explore my own intellectual virtues and analyze how they are used in my everyday life. 
                    The intellectual that I will analyze are intellectual humility, the detective’s virtues, and 
                    the teaching virtue. To start off we first need to identify what virtues are and what intellectual 
                    virtues aim at. A virtue is ‘a deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a characteristic 
                    motivation to produce a certain desired end and reliable success in bringing about that end’. This definition 
                    of virtues by Linda Zagzebskiwill be linked to Aristotle’s view of intellectual virtues. Aristotle notes 
                    that intellectual virtues aim at speculative insight or theoretical knowledge and pertain to practical 
                    thinking, for example, techné and phronesis. It is also worth noting here that these virtues can be acquired 
                    by training through imitation of virtuous persons, acting vigorously, and handling of certain feelings. 
                </h3>

                <h2>
                    Intellectual Humility
                </h2>
                <h3>The first intellectual virtue that I will explore is intellectual humility and will refer to it as humility throughout this essay. I define humility as a disposition 
                    not to make unwarranted intellectual entitlement claims on the basis of one’s superiority or excellence, ‘out of either a concern of self-exaltation, or some other 
                    vicious concern, or no vicious concern at all’. Humility is also considered the opposite of intellectual arrogance, which is a vice. Now there are other definitions 
                    to humility as well, for example, Julia Driver’s description of it as a dogmatic disposition to underestimate one’s worth where the individual is presented with all the evidence 
                    of his evidence, yet he refuses to believe it and ignores his worth. I, however, argue that it is where the individual has the complete evidence and believes in his worth, 
                    yet does not make any entitled claim on the basis of his worth and fosters productive intellectual ends when conjoined with other intellectual virtues. The individual here
                     will be epistemically better off for having humility; his humility will help him in reaching better intellectual ends and in the functioning of the social context with 
                     which he is networking. </h3>
                    <h2>Detective's Virtue</h2>
                    <h3>The second virtue I will explore is the detective’s virtue. The detective’s virtue refers to the coherent explanations of the facts and ideas around one. 
                        I mean with this is the intent to question and seek an answer to all possible ideas around an individual. This can be an exploration of mathematical concepts or the 
                        exploration of human behavior in relation to one’s beliefs. These explanations, however, must be coherent and free of any bias while thinking. Now I will relate this 
                        with my experience in the U.S. My move from the Pakistani culture to the American culture resulted in new interpretations for life, academics, and social issues. These 
                        interpretations were quite different from the one’s I had back then and my reaction should have been, to have the detective’s virtue, to analyze what made both these 
                        situations different from each other and what situation is the one I should follow. Aristotle, too, considers the act of contemplation as the most prized activity. 
                        This doesn’t mean that he doesn’t give importance to other virtues; one should practice those virtues when opportunities arise, but to contemplate one does not need the right. 
                        I would just want a little breathing room alone to think about my surroundings. His argument that, to me, made most sense was for why a life of philosophical contemplation must be 
                        the happiest life (a life of Eudaimonia). Here, in Nicomachean Ethics, he refers to contemplation as an activity of the gods because they do not bother for other virtues like 
                        courage, justice, or temperance. As important these are for us, the addition of contemplation is the thing that gods appreciate the most. Now contemplation to me is what leads 
                        to the detective’s virtue. Ideas around one need to be thought of so that an individual can end up with coherent explanations regarding it. For me, personally, I think I try to 
                        contemplate and think of coherent explanations of ideas around me. However, these ideas are the ones that interest me the most and I believe that one can simply not explore all 
                        the ideas and explanations that exist. Also, these explanations that I end up concluding usually change after some time because of added information gained at a later stage, 
                        this doesn’t undermine what I have concluded but just makes my conclusion more coherent in nature. </h3>
            <h2>
                Teaching Virtue
            </h2>
            <h3>Following the detective’s virtue, another intellectual virtue that I will explore is the teaching virtue. The teaching virtue refers to the social virtue of being communicative, 
                including intellectual candor and knowing your audience and how they respond. This virtue is example of one that enable individuals to live good in communities. It is important to 
                note Aristotle’s opion here where the acquisition of virtue is already social since, as mentioned above, virtue is acquired by imitation virtuous persons. The teaching virtue is a broad 
                virtue that is a kind of a social ability that lead to a community in which all have the opportunity to live well. This can be linked with humility where the idea of empathy was highlighted 
                and how it is important to know how individuals will respond, for example, the inferior might be demotivated if he is intellectually inferior to me. This ability to recognize social norms and 
                values is, according to me, necessary for transforming existing social norms. Here, I can highlight the relation of this virtue to a pure virtue theory and specifically, happiness based theory. 
                This is because this virtue can lead to flourishing of the human communities and hence I can associate flourishing with the life of Eudaimonia. One can argue on the attempt to make Eudaimonia the 
                ground of the value of this virtue as it can also be considered instrumental in nature as Eudaimonia is brought about by this virtue. However, my belief in the happiness-based approach is largely 
                due to the idea of how normal people look forward to it as a primary incentive and how this virtue directly leads to happiness. Now to see how this virtue relates to myself, I believe that I do have 
                this virtue, however, I have seen myself avoid performing the first part of this virtue at certain instances only because I do not feel like performing the virtue. I consider the performance of 
                this virtue as something not part of me where I have to move out of my comfort zone to be intellectually condor. The ideas that I come up are to remain inside me and if they are wrong, I might 
                end up embarrassing myself. While I know this is wrong, I still see myself not being fully honest during conversations. </h3>
